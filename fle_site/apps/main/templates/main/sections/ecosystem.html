			<h3>Learn, Online or Offline</h3>
			<p>Connectivity shouldn’t be a barrier to accessing a high quality education. Kolibri is a powerful tool that enables educators in disadvantaged contexts to integrate and distribute their own unique educational content completely offline, through an offline server that is accessible through a local network. Data is stored on the local server and synced with an online repository once it reaches an internet connection, enabling students to engage with educational materials from the internet, even when internet connection is unreliable.</p>

		<h3>Offline Syncing and Sharing</h3>
		<p>Kolibri also provides two offline alternatives to help students and teachers share data, content, and software updates with devices.</p>

		<h3>Peer to peer sync</h3>
		<p>With the “device discovery” interface, devices can find and directly connect with each other over a local offline wifi network, allowing for easy content sharing and data updates. </p>

	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h3>Sneakernet</h3>
		<p>Kolibri is also designed for easy transfer of content, data, and updates via the “sneakernet.” Users can use USB memory sticks to sync and share content, data, and updates through a web interface. They still have the freedom to choose what and where to sync  in their local filesystem.</p>

		<h3>Vectorization of Content</h3>
		<p>Vectorization of content helps to dramatically reduce file size to save memory space. We achieve this by converting educational videos into a sequence of drawing actions instead of a video file, which is then displayed in the web browser to simulate a video. This allows us to preload content onto our devices so you don’t have to.</p>

		<h3>Cross Platform Installation on Any Device</h3>
		<p>Kolibri is an application that can be installed on any platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android) or device. Students and teachers can use any inexpensive, low-power device, such as an Android tablet, and still be able to engage with rich educational content through Kolibri.</p>
