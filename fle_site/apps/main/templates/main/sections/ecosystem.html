			<h3>Open Source Educational Content</h3>
			<p>This means that all the educational content that Kolibri offers for curation is licensed to be freely distributed and remixed for your own curricular needs.</p>
				<br>
			<h3>Learn, Online or Offline</h3>

			<p>Learners can engage with high-quality educational material from the internet, even when internet connection is unreliable. Kolibri will enable educators to integrate and distribute their unique educational content through an offline server that is accessible through a local network. Content and data is stored on the local server and synced with an online repository once it reaches an internet connection.</p>
